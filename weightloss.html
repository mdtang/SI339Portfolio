        <h4>Before I Started..</h4>
        <p>In 2016, I was 274 lbs. I have always thought of losing weight, but I didn't really find a methodical way to get started and not give up. I have tried multiple times to lose weight by running and watching what I eat, but it was all to no avail.

      <h4>How I Started...</h4>
      <p>On October 27th, 2016, I started my weight loss journey. I ordered a food scale and started using MyFitnessPal to track my caloric intake.</p>

      <h4>Sudden Realization</h4>
      <p>From the end of October to the end of January, I managed to eat around 1800 calories and lose 2-3 pounds a week. By the end of January, I weighed 250 pounds.</p>
      <p>However, I began to realize that if I kept losing weight like this, I would look very weak and lose both fat and muscle mass. I also would not have any endurance and stamina after losing tons of weight.</p>
      <p>With this realization in mind, I started on a beginner weightlifting program for 4 times a aweek, and used the <a href="http://www.c25k.com/" alt="c25k website">Couch to 5K Program</a> to jog 3 times a week.</p>

        <h4>Difficult Hurdles</h4>
        <p>This was an insanely difficult start on both a physical and mental level.</p>
        <p>It was difficult to exercise at such a high volume because it is something that I was not used to. Not only that, I was anxious about going to the gym and starting out as an absolute beginner.</p>
        <p>But I ignored all of the outside pressure and kept at it.</p>

        <h4>Signs of Success,..but The Journey Is Not Over</h4>
        <p>As weeks go by, I became more confident in my ability to reach my goal weight. However, my exercise routine became increasingly harder. The weights got heavier and the length of each run became longer as the program progressed.</p>
        <p>But I never gave up or skipped any days.</p>
        <p>In Summer 2017, I reached my goal weight of 180 pounds. I have continued to weightlift and gain muscle, and exercising has become an integral part of my life.</p>
